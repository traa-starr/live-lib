## Weekly rhythm

### Monday: intake

Add one to three new resources, each with tags and a short description.

### Wednesday: synthesis

Review saved items and write one short synthesis note in your own language.

### Friday: execution

Select one idea and ship one visible change in your work.

## Why this works

The loop stays lightweight and repeatable. Consistency beats intensity in long-term knowledge systems.
