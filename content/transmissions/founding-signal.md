# Founding Signal

The library exists to keep your best ideas close to daily action.

## The premise

A living library is not about collecting links. It is about sequencing ideas into useful motion.

### Working definition

Capture less. Distill more. Return often.

## Initial protocol

Choose one resource this week and produce one concrete operational change from it.
