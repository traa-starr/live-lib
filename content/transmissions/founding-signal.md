## Why this exists

A library is not a scrapbook. It is an operational surface for better choices.

The goal is simple:

1. Capture only what is high-signal.
2. Distill it into reusable language.
3. Retrieve the right idea fast when pressure is real.

## What makes this different

- Every entry is structured markdown with frontmatter.
- Search spans titles, tags, summaries, and content text.
- Transmissions explain how to use the system, not just what to collect.
