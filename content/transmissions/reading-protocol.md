# Reading Protocol for Applied Minds

Reading becomes meaningful when it changes what you notice, decide, and execute.

## Step one: frame intent

Name the decision domain before you read.

## Step two: mark leverage

Track ideas that can alter your next seven days.

### Step three: commit

Translate one insight into one scheduled action.
