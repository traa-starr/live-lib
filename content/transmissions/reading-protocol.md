## Protocol

When you open a new resource, do this in order:

1. Define the question you need answered.
2. Extract only the high-leverage points.
3. Convert one point into a scheduled action.

## Integration rule

If a resource does not change a decision, it has not been integrated yet.

## Cadence

Run this loop weekly. Low drama beats high intensity.
